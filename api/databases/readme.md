# Databases

Feathers database adapters are [services](../services/readme.md) that write to a database. Instead of coming up with our own ORM and validation system our official database adapters simply wrap many of the great ORM/ODM solutions that already exist.

> **Important:** We recommend being familiar with the [common interface](commond.md) chapter before using a specific database adapter.

Every official database adapter supports [common functionality](common.md) for initialization, [pagination and sorting](pagination.md) and [advanced querying](querying.md) out of the box and can be [extended](extending.md) with custom functionality. Errors from the adapters (like ORM validation errors) will be passed seamlessly to clients.

This allows you to swap databases whenever the need arises **without having to change any of your querying code or validation hooks** and you can even use multiple databases within the same app.

> **Important:** If your database of choice is not officially supported you can still implement it as [your own service](../service/readme.md) and get hooks and real-time updates for that database. Also, have a look at the [Ecosystem](../ecosystem/readme.md) section to see if there isn't a community supported adapter for the database already.
