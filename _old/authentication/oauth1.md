# OAuth1 & OAuth1a Authentication

Coming Soon!

Because Twitter doesn't support OAuth2 for authentication we need to use OAuth1. OAuth1 requires a session, which kind of defeats the purpose of using JWT based authentication so we intentionally chose to leave OAuth1 out of the Feathers 2 release.

We are planning on adding it over the coming months. If you'd like to help out with this effort please head over to the [feathers-authentication repo](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-authentication).
