# Building a Front-end

So far in this chapter we created a REST and real-time API to send messages including authentication and user management. We also added a static login and signup HTML page. Now it is time to use that API in a frontend. Feathers works great with any client that can connect through HTTP(S) or websockets to a REST API. For more details on what commands to send and listen to, follow up in the [client use chapter](../clients/readme.md). Sometimes it is just a few lines of code to make an existing front-end turn real-time.

Feathers is also universally usable and provides a [JavaScript client](../clients/feathers.md) that works in the Browser, React Native and other NodeJS servers. This makes it very easy to integrate with most JavaScript libraries and client side frameworks. In the [frameworks section](../frameworks/readme.md) we've put together a growing list of integration guides to build real-time front-ends for the chat API we created in this chapter:

- [jQuery Feathers Chat](../frameworks/jquery.md)
- [React Feathers Chat](../frameworks/react.md)
- [Vue.js Feathers Chat](../frameworks/vuejs.md)
- [Feathers and Angular 2](../frameworks/angular2.md)
- [Feathers and Choo](../frameworks/choo.md)

If you don't see your favourite framework, do not despair! We have more information on how to use a Feathers API on the client in the [Client Use chapter](../clients/readme.md) and we're always open for [suggestions and questions](../help/readme.md). If you think you can help write a guide, we'd love to hear from you!
