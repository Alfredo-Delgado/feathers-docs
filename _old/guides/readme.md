# Guides

This is where we will have guides for common situations. We will be adding to this section over time but if you have done something cool with Feathers that we don't already have a guide for feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-docs/edit/master/guides/readme.md).

Naturally, our first guide is [how you can migrate to your existing app to Feathers 2](./migrating.md).
